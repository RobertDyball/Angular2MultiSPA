# Angular 2 ASP.NetCore Multi-SPA framework

This repository holds the source of a framework in progress. 

Currently it uses an ASP.Net Core backend, Angular 2.0.0 front end, and will be styled with the latest Bootstrap 4.0.
Soon to be added tag helpers and code generation from the data model.


For further background details, see the Github Wiki here: https://github.com/RobertDyball/Angular2MultiSPA/wiki
or follow the blog posts here: http://dyball.wordpress.com

Done so far: 

- Switched from standard Angular HTML template to a template created with an ASP.Net Core partial view 
  This allows use of razor syntax, since the templates are served from CSHTML files, and anything else ASP.Net / MVC programmers are used to including tag helpers
  i.e., inject server side smarts into otherwise plain flat-HTML client-side markup.
  (more CSHTML/HTML templates to come when Angular 2 routing is added)
- Switched from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4
- Add initial cut of Angular 2 routing, re-implemented Bootstrap navbar / menu
- Added EF Core, and a SQL backend (using Northwind) to demonstrate data model generation using database-first
- Main data model now separated into a separate project
- Set up an intial, separate View Model, and simple fetch of data and images from Web API through to an Angular 2 service

TODO 
(not necessarily in this order):

- Add JWT token authentication, probably using OpenIdDict
- Use EF Core to generate data migration and SQL seeding
- Add Chuck Norris Roundhouse to create versioned SQL scripts generated by EF
- Add Tag Helpers to automatically create boiler-plate client code based on view models, attributes decorating view model properties will generate code directly, from one place in the code.
- Add Swagger (probably NSwag) to create a map of Web API calls, and be able to auto generate Typescript code for Angular 2 services + data classes
- Add native Angular 2 Bootstrap library; Perhaps ng-bootstrap or ng2-bootstrap.  

## Prerequisites

Latest ASP.Net Core (currently 1.0.1) see http://asp.net
Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, with ASP.Net core tooling updates, or Visual Studio code.

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development and used by Visual Studio. 
  

## Running

Pull a copy of the repo, load the solution into Visual Studio, build (which will restore dependencies), and hit F5 or ctrl-F5

The original about and contact ASP.Net pages have now been removed, the default home/index page now loads the angular dependencies through layout, replacing the index.html in previous drop.
To view just clone, build and browse http://localhost:7010/ to see the Angular 2 using an ASP.Net partial page, with CSHTML running razor into the Angular template.

## Background

Here's a brief explanation of what happens, and a little of why.

All of us have seen code turn to spaghetti and think we're going to avoid it next time.

Ideally we're hoping to get a useful integration of the best of an ASP.Net Core backend with an Angular 2 front end, and not lose the strengths of both platforms. 

Some people use an ASP.Net or ASP.Net Core or other) back end platform to serve up their Angular scripts and views and provide data using Web API, however these tend to ignore tag helpers or many of the other benefits of ASP.Net core.

Others go the other way, making the server fulfil a complex range of tasks, often setting up pre-loaded data into views, but this can create quite a complex code base with a very steep learning curve.

Here we hope to experiment in collaboration and produce a framework that provides a starting point for many business scenarios.

We'll try and keep things using cross platform features of ASP.Net Core that is capable of being deployed to Windows or Linux servers or makeuse of Docker containers.
